Date : 12th January 2005

Macro Version v1.30
Assembler Version v1.20

This is the 7th release of PicoBlaze for Spartan-3, Virtex-II, Virtex-IIPro and Virtex-4 devices. 

Note that the main documentation for this macro, User Guide (UG129), is not included in 
this package. It should be downloaded from the PicoBlaze web site (www.xilinx.com/picoblaze)
where a forum and other user pages can also be accessed. 



New information
---------------

This is the second release of KCPSM3 in Verilog as well as VHDL. This release has been made to 
correct some simulation issues with the UART macros supplied in Verilog. There are no other 
changes or additions at this time.

My thanks to Nick Sawyer and Shalin Sheth of Xilinx for their continued efforts in supporting 
the Verilog files. 


Relatively New Information
--------------------------

Do check out the JTAG loader utility which allows rapid modifications to be made to PSM 
programs during development. Once you have used it once, you will use it all the time.  
Thanks here to Kristian Chaplin of Xilinx for this very useful tool. 

The assembler has a new 'INST' directive (please read Additional Assembler Notes).

Verilog code. Use of the PicoBlaze forum is also encouraged.  


Quick Description
-----------------

KCPSM3 is a very simple 8-bit micro controller designed to be 100% embedded into a 
Spartan-3 or Virtex-II(PRO)/Virtex-4 device and is based on the popular KCPSM and 
KCPSM2 macros which have the collective name 'PicoBlaze'.

It features 16 general purpose registers and an internal 64-byte scratch pad memory. 
A simple ALU supporting addition, subtraction, compare, logical operations and testing 
including parity, shifts and rotates. The ALU also supports Carry and Zero flags which
can be used in conditional jumps and calls. An internal program counter stack supports 
nested subroutines automatically. Controls include a reset, an interrupt and interrupt
acknowledge. 

The KCPSM3 assembler is supplied to assist in the development of programs. 

Performance >44 MIPS. Best of all, it uses just 96 slices 
   - you could fit 12 of them into an XC3S200 device, but would you ever need to?!

The main documentation is provided in User Guide UG129 and is supplemented by the original 
'KCPSM3_manual.pdf' supplied with this package.


Important Note
--------------

It should be appreciated that it is virtually impossible to fully test a processor given
the almost infinite number of combinations of code and signals which can be encountered. 
However, KCPSM3 benefited greatly from being based heavily on the experience gained with 
KCPSM and KCPSM2 which are extremely stable designs used by thousands of engineers for 
nearly five years. KCPSM3 was completed in June 2003 and has been a used by many engineers
in a wide range of applications during the past 12 months.

So although this version of KCPSM3 and the assembler are believed to be stable and fully 
operational, your help is requested in the continuous verification of the functionality
of the KCPSM3 macro and assembler. All reports, (good or bad) or recommendations will be 
gratefully received by the author.....

KCPSM3 Macro Revision History
-----------------------------

V1.00 - First release to users.
V1.10 - Change of '--translate off' and '--translate on' meta command directives 
        to '--synthesis translate off' and '--synthesis translate on'. 
V1.20 - Addition of code to enhance simulation. No functional changes. 
V1.30 - Functional change. The ENABLE INTERRUPT instruction is used to enable 
        the interrupt input and an active interrupt automatically disables future
        interrupts. The functional change was made to deal with a situation in which
        the ENABLE INTERRUPT instruction is being used in a program at a point where
        the interrupt input is already enabled. If the execution of this instruction
        occurred at the same time as an active interrupt event, the net effect was 
        that the interrupts were not disabled by the interrupt event. The change 
        has no effect on any other situation. 

        An improvement to the ZERO and CARRY flag logic was also made which has no 
        effect on functionality but is an enhancement to performance.

Assembler Files
---------------

**NOTE** You must copy KCPSM3.EXE, ROM_form.vhd, ROM_form.v and ROM_form.coe into 
your working director regardless of which HDL language you are using. Please also 
read "Additional Assembler Notes" included later.


KCPSM3.EXE - The assembler for KCPSM3 programs.

ROM_form.vhd - VHDL template file read by the assembler and used to define the 
               style in which the program ROM will be implemented. This file 
               must be placed in the same working directory as KCPSM3.EXE.

Additional Assembler Notes
--------------------------

Copy KCPSM3.EXE into your working directory. You must also copy the template 
files ROM_form.vhd, ROM_form.v and ROM_form.coe into the same directory. All template 
files are required, regardless of the design flow you intend to use.

You can modify the template files (see documentation), but no checking of syntax
is performed by the assembler. The JTAG loader uses different templates which are 
provided.

The assembler is only a simple DOS based utility. File names have a limit of 8-characters
and care should be taken not to use in a project directory with a very deep hierarchy 
requiring a long path specification. If you encounter an unexpected failure, please 
attempt to assemble you program in a simple directory such as c:\temp to determine if 
the problem is related to these DOS limitations. 

The assembler is normally used by first opening a DOS window in the working directory
and then executing KCPSM3 from within that window (please see KCPSM3_manual.pdf). 
Attempting to execute KCPSM3.EXE  directly from within Windows will only cause a DOS 
box to be displayed momentarily providing no opportunity to enter a PSM file name.

It is highly recommended that all files required by the assembler are located in the 
same working directory. Users have been successful using this utility on various networks
but the author will not support or address any issues related to any difficulties 
resulting from using KCPSM3 in this way.

To redirect the DOS screen output to a file the > symbol can be used in the DOS 
command line. 

C:\DESIGN>kcpsm3 simple > screen_dump.txt

Many PicoBlaze users have also reported how much they like the free assembler and 
simulator provided by Mediatronix. 


INST Directive

Version v1.20 of the assembler introduces a new 'INST' directive which allows the 
definition of any instruction code in line with the existing instructions. The INST
directive has only one operand which must be a 5 digit hexadecimal value in the range
00000 to 3FFFF corresponding to the 18-bit instruction memory formed in a Block RAM.

Examples of valid syntax for INST directive

    INST 3245C
    INST 14FA2
    inst 2abfe

This directive was added to enable data to be embedded within the program memory
space which can then be accessed via the second port of the dual port Block RAM. 
The INST directives will normally be preceded by the ADDRESS directive to locate 
such data at a predictable location within the memory space.

Obviously great care should be taken to ensure that data values are not encountered by 
KCPSM3 during normal operation as the macro does not support illegal op-code trapping.
 


More than 96 slices or less than 96 slices! 
-------------------------------------------

When synthesizing the 'kcpsm3.vhd' file using XST (Release 6.1.01i - xst G.24) the 
reported design figures for all the primitive components will be correct. However, the 
'Device utilization summary' will provide an estimate of 131 slices for the final size.
Fortunately, the MAP tool is able to recognise the relationship between the large 
number of primitives and achieve the much smaller size of 96 slices.

Occasionally constraints on the design may result in a small increase in size when 
mapped. For example, forcing the mapping into a rectangular area has been shown to 
result in a size of 98 slices.

A figure of 91 slices can be achieved by adjusting the MAP property called 
'CLB Pack Factor Percentage' to '1' (default is '100'). This should be considered as
the minimum size for the complete macro.

It is quite common to not utilise all the available input and output signals of the 
KCPSM3 macro in the system design. For example, the INTERRUPT input may be connected
to 'GND' and READ_STROBE and INTERRUPT_ACK may be left unconnected. This can result in 
a small reduction in size as the MAP tool removes unnecessary logic. However, the 
reductions in size will be in the order of a few slices and any significant reduction
should be investigated as this would most likely indicate an error in your design 
(i.e. failure to connect a valid clock input). 



Potential synthesis issue
-------------------------

The HDL supplied for the KCPSM3 macro and the HDL generated by the assembler 
(derived from the ROM_form templates) has been written to be suitable for both 
synthesis and simulation. 

In order for a simulator to have the correct information, the code includes 'INIT'
values defined using 'generic map' statements for each primitive component.
Synthesis tools also require the 'INIT' values to be defined, but in this case the 
definition is performed using a separate 'attribute' statements'. The synthesis tool 
must then be instructed to ignore the 'generic map' information which is achieved
using meta command directives. Unfortunately, there is no real standard for these 
directives and different synthesis tools will expect slightly different syntax.

The supplied HDL has been written using the directives '--synthesis translate_off'
and '--synthesis translate_on' and can be seen in the code as shown in this example:-

  t_state_lut: LUT1
  --synthesis translate_off
    generic map (INIT => X"1")         
  --synthesis translate_on
  port map( I0 => t_state,
             O => not_t_state );

If your synthesis tool reports any issues with processing the 'INIT' values declared 
as part of the 'generic map' statements then it is not ignoring these lines as intended.
In this case you should globally replace the directives in the 'kcpsm3' and 
'ROM_form' files to match the requirements of your synthesis tool. The syntax 
variants of this meta command directive encountered by the author are as follows:-

--translate_off                --translate_on 
--synthesis translate_off      --synthesis translate_on
--synopsys translate_off       --synopsys translate_on
--pragma translate_off         --pragma translate_on

XST is able to interpret all of the above variants so '--synthesis translate_off'
and '--synthesis translate_on' have been used in the supplied code because it is
the most frequently acceptable variant by other synthesis tools.


Simulation with VHDL-87
-----------------------

Some VHDL simulators may not be able to use the VHDL supplied as it uses various VHDL-93
constructs. In this case, it may be better to generate a simulation model for KCPSM3
using the following command....

ngd2vhdl kcspm3.ngd sim_model_kcpsm3.vhd

Obviously, this model should not then be used for synthesis.
